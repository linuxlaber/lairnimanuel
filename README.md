Version 1.0 Release Date: May 23, 2024

This is a demo app. Although it looks complete, I am still planning on adding alot of features on the program. For now, the app was on private as I am still experimenting on how Github operates. Will convert to public soon. I am planning to make this program my very own workspace so I will be adding tons of features in the near future. I am also planning on adding the databases I collected from my other experiments. However, I won't allow access to the public as the data's gathered might be important for. You can ask for access by emailing my gmail account (linuxlaber@gmail.com) but don't be confident. I won't allow access to my database servers unless you agreed for a meeting (zoom, discord, etc.) first. That's all Thank you!

Version 1.0 New Features: (Current)
The very first program. No new features for now. However, this is the very first program I uploaded on Github so I was very happy.
